# HandSignDecoder

A Convolutional Neural Network based **Sign Language Detection** on **Android Application**.

## Getting Started

Sign language is the communication medium used by the deaf and dumb people around the world. We choose Android Application to implement sign language. Here we work with sign language detection for alphabets sign. We have mainly focused on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 

## Features
This app will let users:
* To know about the Sign Language of Alphabets.
* To learn the Sign Language of Alphabets from Tutoral.
* To Test own progress in real time using camera.
